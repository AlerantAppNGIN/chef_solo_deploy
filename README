This is a simple chef-solo deploy package.

I've followed the instructions precisely as per
http://opinionated-programmer.com/2011/06/chef-solo-tutorial-managing-a-single-server-with-chef/
for the initial commit, including the example default.rb recipe file.

I will work this down to a more reasonable base minimum for master, and branch off from there for specific server usages. Any useful recipes will probably be moved into master, but the branching/merging structure is still undecided.
